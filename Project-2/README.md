MoviieFanatics is a dynamic web application with an intuitive user interface that allows both guests and logged in members to the website to view a featured movie, the most popular movies, best reviewed movies of the year, comedies and dramas all on the home page. 

I was responsible for creating a new user and displaying information for members on their personal profile pages and their public profiles. I did this by using the HttpClient module on the Angular side to communicate with the correct endpoint established by Spring MVC and extract or insert data using Spring Data.
