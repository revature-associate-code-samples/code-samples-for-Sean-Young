Four applications that have been worked on during my time at Revature.

## Project-1-ERS-Reimbursement
This was a expense reimbursement system full-stack web application that allowed users to login and submit reimbursements. Managers can either accept or deny these reimbursement requests.
## Project-2-MovieFanatics
This application kept track of users favorite movies, user comments, and user likes. Users could login and view other user profiles to see their favorite movies.
## Project-3-Caliber-Audit
